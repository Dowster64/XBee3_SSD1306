# XBee3_SSD1306

Edited https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306 to work with XBee3 MicroPython.  

Tested on Xbee3 TH module with 802.15.4 200A firmware. _i2c only_  Tested with 128x64 OLED.

Thank you to Adafruit for releasing this under the MIT license.  :-)

The directory struture is as required for the flash. I suggest that you use PyCharm with the XBee Mycropython Plugin fo the most straightforward experience. Don't forget to exclude unwanted files.

The main.py program runs as per the test framebuf test script in the original repo. 
You will see the print output at the XBee's REPL prompt.
